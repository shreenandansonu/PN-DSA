Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm that sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and putting it at the beginning.

Here's how the algorithm works:

Start with the first element of the array.

Find the minimum element from the remaining elements of the array.

Swap the minimum element with the first element.

Repeat steps 2 and 3 for the remaining unsorted part of the array, until the entire array is sorted.
